# FreelancePay - Complete Testing Guide

## ✅ What's Built and Ready

**Fully Integrated Platform:**
- Smart contracts deployed on local Hardhat network
- Backend API with AI verification (OpenAI)
- Frontend with blockchain transaction support
- Database tracking (Supabase)
- Automatic test USDC minting

---

## Prerequisites

Before testing, you need:
1. ✅ Hardhat node running (contracts deployed)
2. ✅ Backend server running
3. ✅ Frontend server running
4. ✅ MetaMask connected to localhost network
5. ⏳ Supabase tables created

---

## Step-by-Step Testing

### Step 1: Set Up Supabase Tables (5 minutes)

```bash
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Click your project: cdzdrlldltfijpfdaqkf
3. Left sidebar → SQL Editor
4. Click "New Query"
5. Copy everything from: backend/schema.sql
6. Paste and click "Run"
7. Should see: "Success. No rows returned"
8. Click "Table Editor" - verify tables exist: jobs, users, reviews
```

### Step 2: Start Hardhat Node (Terminal 1)

```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat node
```

**Keep this running!** You should see:
```
Started HTTP and WebSocket JSON-RPC server at http://127.0.0.1:8545/
Account #0: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 (10000 ETH)
...
```

### Step 3: Start Backend API (Terminal 2)

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

Should see:
```
freelancepay api running on port 3000
supabase: connected
openai: connected
```

### Step 4: Start Frontend (Terminal 3)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Browser opens at: **http://localhost:5173**

### Step 5: Connect MetaMask to Local Network

**Add Localhost Network:**
1. Open MetaMask
2. Click network dropdown → "Add network"
3. "Add a network manually"
4. Enter:
   - Network name: `Localhost 8545`
   - RPC URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
   - Chain ID: `31337`
   - Currency: `ETH`
5. Save

**Import Test Account:**
1. MetaMask → Account → Import Account
2. Paste private key: `0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80`
3. This is Hardhat's test account #0 with 10,000 ETH

### Step 6: Connect Wallet in App

1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Approve in MetaMask
4. You should see your address in top right
5. Make sure MetaMask shows "Localhost 8545" network

### Step 7: Create Your First Job (With Blockchain!)

1. Click "Create Job" tab
2. Fill in form:
   - Title: `Test React Component`
   - Description: `Build a simple navbar for testing`
   - Freelancer address: `0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8` (Hardhat account #1)
   - Amount: `50`
   - Category: `Code`
3. Click "Create Job & Lock Funds"

**Watch the magic happen:**
- Status shows: "Creating job in database..."
- Status shows: "Checking USDC balance..."
- Status shows: "Minting test USDC..." (first time only)
- MetaMask popup: Approve test USDC mint
- Status shows: "Approving USDC..."
- MetaMask popup: Approve USDC spending
- Status shows: "Creating job on blockchain..."
- MetaMask popup: Confirm job creation transaction
- Status shows: "Linking to database..."
- Success message with transaction hash!

4. Check "My Jobs" tab - job should be there with status "Active"

### Step 8: View Job Details

1. Go to "My Jobs"
2. Toggle "As Client" - see your job
3. Note the status: "Active"
4. Job shows amount: $50 USDC
5. Job shows description and details

### Step 9: Check Blockchain Transaction

**In Hardhat Node Terminal** (Terminal 1):
- You'll see transaction logs for:
  - USDC mint
  - USDC approve
  - Job creation

**Check Contract State:**
```bash
# In contracts directory
node -e "
const ethers = require('ethers');
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('http://127.0.0.1:8545');
const abi = require('./artifacts/contracts/FreelanceEscrow.sol/FreelanceEscrow.json').abi;
const contract = new ethers.Contract('0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512', abi, provider);
contract.jobs(0).then(job => console.log('Job 0:', job));
"
```

You should see the job data on-chain!

### Step 10: Check Database

1. Go to Supabase dashboard
2. Table Editor → `jobs` table
3. You should see your job with:
   - chain_job_id: 0
   - status: active
   - tx_hash: 0x...
   - All other details

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Please connect your wallet"
- Make sure MetaMask is connected
- Check you're on "Localhost 8545" network
- Refresh page and reconnect

### "USDC transfer failed"
- Hardhat node might have restarted
- Restart hardhat node, redeploy contracts
- Update contract address in .env files

### Backend won't start
- Check Supabase URL and keys in `backend/.env`
- Make sure OpenAI API key is valid
- Check port 3000 is free: `lsof -i :3000`

### Frontend errors
- Clear browser cache
- Check console for errors
- Make sure hardhat node is running
- Verify contract address in `frontend/.env`

### MetaMask transaction fails
- Check you're on correct network (31337)
- Make sure you imported the test account
- Check hardhat node is running
